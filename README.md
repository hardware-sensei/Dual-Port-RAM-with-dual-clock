# Dual-Port-RAM-with-dual-clock
Dual Port RAM with dual clock in Verilog HDL
This Repository presents the design of a Random Access Memory which is used to store data. The RAM has two ports, both have read and write functionality.
Both ports have their own clock signals, which makes this design asynchronous in nature.
The RAM can be shared among two separate processors both of which can read(write) data from(to) it simultaneously.
This type of RAM is used for high speed(frequency) and low size data transfers between two asynchronous systems.
Hence, applications which require varying level of complexity, and utilize two processors are heavily sped up by the use of dual port memories.
